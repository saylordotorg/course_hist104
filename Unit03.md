**Unit 3: Research Challenges** <span id="3"></span> 
*<span>Historical research can be challenging.  Sources may be difficult
to understand or may appear contradictory.  Projects involving large
amounts of quantitative data can be hard to organize and present to
others.  Historical research in the real world often involves long hours
of searching records for small pieces of data.  Occasionally,
researchers may run across information that they do not understand or
that takes their project in a completely different direction.  In this
unit, we will address some of the everyday challenges that historical
researchers face and look at how experienced researchers deal with these
issues.  We will also address how overcoming these challenges can lead
to research breakthroughs and unexpected discoveries.</span>*

    sources were written.  Contradictions in sources may provide
    valuable insights into the thoughts and motivations of the sources’
    creators.  The class also discusses the place of statistical data in
    historical research and the challenges of determining the accuracy
    and historical relevance of such data.</span>
