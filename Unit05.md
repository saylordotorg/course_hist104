**Unit 5: Research Libraries** <span id="5"></span> 
*<span>Research libraries are excellent locations for starting
historical research projects.  These libraries generally contain books,
journals, and other materials on a wide variety of historical subjects. 
Reference librarians will assist researches by identifying and locating
materials for their projects and providing guidance about individual
libraries’ holdings.  Research libraries also have online catalogues
that will help researchers locate materials quickly and efficiently.  In
this unit, we will look at how to conduct historical research at
research libraries and examine some of the research tools that these
libraries have available for patrons. </span>*

    the web-based Iliad).  When books, journals, and other research
    materials are not available through a local research library,
    InterLibrary Loan allows researchers to submit requests for these
    materials from other libraries.  InterLibrary Loan requests may be
    filled out online and submitted to libraries electronically.  Local
    libraries will alert patrons when the requested materials are
    available for local pickup.</span>
