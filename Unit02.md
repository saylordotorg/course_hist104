**Unit 2: Basic Historical Research Skills** <span id="2"></span> 
*Historians must employ basic research and writing skills in order to
present information about the past to others.  Researchers should not
start investigating a topic until they prepare a basic research agenda. 
Developing a thesis and formulating research questions will help a
historian stay focused on his or her topic.  Researchers must know how
to locate primary and secondary sources on their subjects and conduct
research using these sources.  Finally, researchers must be able to
organize their information and produce a research essay, or
informational document, that explains what they learned about the topic
and the significance of their research.  In this unit, we will examine
the preliminary steps that historians must take before they begin
research, and we will learn how to obtain historical information using
primary and secondary sources.  We will also examine how to organize
historical data and write a formal history essay or research report.*

     Instructions: Read the Introduction, Chapter One, and Chapter Ten
    of Dr. Steven D. Krause’s textbook.  
        
     In his introduction and first chapter, Dr. Steven D. Krause offers
    a basic guide to college-level research and writing.  In the
    introduction, he introduces the concept of “academic research” and
    discusses the elements that make up an academic research paper.  He
    also talks about the basic starting points for academic research on
    any subject.  In Chapter One, Professor Krause goes into greater
    detail about different types of academic research and discusses some
    of the basic challenges that an academic researcher faces in the
    modern age.  Chapter Ten focuses on the challenges of writing a
    research essay.  We will address the specific elements of the essay
    in greater detail in subsequent subunits.
