**Unit 6: How to Use an Archive** <span id="6"></span> 
*<span>Archives maintain collections of primary-source documents and
historical objects.  Some archives house documents and objects from many
different sources, while others contain documents and objects from a
single source.  Archives are an important resource for researchers
looking for historical documents about a specific topic.  Archives
maintain catalogues and finding aids for their collections.  Researchers
should refer to these finding aids in order to locate specific
documents.  In this unit, we will learn how to conduct historical
research using archival records.  We will also discuss archival research
practices and various digital technologies that can assist researchers
with their work.</span>*
