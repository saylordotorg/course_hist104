**Unit 8: Other Historical Resources** <span id="8"></span> 
*<span>Primary-source documents are an important resource for
historians, but researchers have additional means at their disposal for
learning about the past.  Researchers can conduct interviews, study
historical objects and structures, and evaluate different forms of
popular media in order to gain more information about how people lived
in the past.  In this unit, we will look at how oral history, material
culture studies, and cultural analysis can be used for historical
research.  We will examine the benefits of each approach and evaluate
how these three historical research practices can complement traditional
primary-source analytical techniques.</span>*
