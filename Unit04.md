**Unit 4: Historiography** <span id="4"></span> 
*Historians are influenced by the unique political, economic, social,
and cultural contexts of their lives.  ‘Consequently, historians have
looked at past events and reached very different conclusions.  The
process of analyzing how historians from different time periods have
interpreted the past is known as historiography.*  
 *             
 Contemporary historical researchers need a basic understanding of
historiography in order to comprehend how the historical profession has
changed over time.  Understanding trends in history research and
interpretation make contemporary scholars more aware of potential biases
in secondary historical sources. *  
 *             
 In this unit, we will explore how history writing has changed over the
past two millennia.  We will also evaluate modern historiographic trends
and look at how these trends have changed the nature of contemporary
historical research and writing.*

     Instructions: Read the article. Italian philosopher Pareto once
    said “all history is current history.”  This review from The Society
    for French Historical Studies illustrates how the historiography of
    the past is altered by the conditions of the present.  In this
    review, Michael Scott Christofferson examines the seminal work of
    François Furet, *Penser la Révolution française,* in light of the
    changing political conditions of the late 1970’s.  François Furet
    has influenced the historiography of the French Revolution arguably
    more than any other living historian.  This is a concrete example of
    modern historiography in action.  The review showcases, how in this
    fast-paced modern world, history can be rewritten within the space
    of a decade.

     <span>Instructions: Read the article on the webpage.</span>  
        
     <span>This article provides a brief explanation of how postmodern
    literary criticism has influenced historical research and writing. 
    Some historians have begun to question whether historical texts can
    really tell us anything about past events.  If we accept the
    premise, as stated by the webpage’s author Lito Apostolakou, that
    “language does not describe reality but constructs reality,” then we
    can never truly understand the past.  Apostolakou worries that such
    a perspective may undermine the historical profession and make
    history largely irrelevant as an academic subject.</span>
