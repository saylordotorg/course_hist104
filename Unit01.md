**Unit 1: Why Study the Past?** <span id="1"></span> 
*Why should we care about the past?  What can we learn from the past? 
How should we study the past?  These three questions form the basis for
modern historical inquiry.  The concept of history can be a challenge to
define and explain.  European historian Eugen Weber once offered a
succinct assessment:  “History is what historians do.”  Regardless of
how we chose to define history, we recognize that learning about the
past can help us better understand the present.  In this unit, we will
examine the different meanings of history and identify some of the
reasons why the study of the past is so important to modern-day
researchers.  We will also look at the resources that historians use to
study the past and discuss the fundamental role that primary-source
evidence plays in historical inquiry.*

     Instructions: Read Professor Paul Halsall’s article “Why Study
    History through Primary Sources.” On this webpage (adapted from
    Historian James Harvey Robinson’s 1904 essay “The Historical Point
    of View”), author Paul Halsall discusses the importance of primary,
    or firsthand, sources for the study of history.  Halsall argues that
    secondary, or secondhand, sources such as history books,
    encyclopedias, and historical chronicles may contain research errors
    or misrepresent past events for various reasons.  The only way a
    researcher can derive an accurate interpretation of past events is
    by looking at primary source evidence that relates to those events. 
    Primary sources are the foundation of historical inquiry and the
    starting point for original research on the past.
