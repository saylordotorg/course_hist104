**Unit 7: Electronic Research Tools** <span id="7"></span> 
*<span>In recent years, the Internet has become a powerful tool for
historical research.  In addition to hosting online catalogues for
physical libraries and archives, the Internet also offers virtual
libraries and archives.  These repositories contain diverse historical
resources, including digital books, journal articles, and primary-source
document collections.  Unfortunately, the Internet also contains
inaccurate and misleading collections of historical data.  Identifying
and locating reputable sources of historical information on the Internet
can be challenging, but this skill will become increasingly necessary
for contemporary historical researchers as more and more information
becomes available online.  In this unit, we will evaluate online
research practices and discuss important Internet-based tools that can
help researchers locate reputable secondary and primary sources.  We
will also examine contemporary trends in online history research and
discuss new approaches that scholars are using to find and evaluate
historical data across the Internet.  </span>*
